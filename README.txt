Chartmetric Take-Home Assignment

Which Assignment I Worked:
I worked on option 1, where I had to create a web page to display a set of data from a given CSV file.

How Long I Spent On The Project:
I spent about 10-11 hours programming the entire application. Roughly half of it was spent setting up the backend and server-side with Node.JS and planning. The remaining time was on the front end.
Also, some of my time for the project time limit was taken up by other things such as sleep (roughly 5.5 hours for rest, work would be another 7.5 hours). In total, I used up the whole 24 hours, however,
the coding aspect specifically took about 10-11 hours. 

I wanted to add a few features, such as a connection to a MySQL database where users can store parsed data for Instagram users, upload their data, and compare them to the parsed users.
However, this was not added as I wanted to maintain the integrity and honesty for the rules of the project for staying within the 24-hour time limit. 

Instructions For Running My Program:
1. Unzip all files into a directory of your choosing.
2. Using an IDE Terminal of your choice, or your command prompt, "cd" into the project directory where you are at the same level as "app.js".
3. On the command prompt, run "npm install" to install the dependencies required.
4. Then run "npm install csv-parser".
5. Upon completion of the previous command, then run "npm start".
6. Go on your browser and enter "http://localhost:3000" as the URL and the project should be viewable!

Explanations Of Any Assignment Struggles (If Any):
I did not face too many struggles throughout this assignment; most of the issues I could debug. One issue that I was able to work around was choosing which language to run my backend on. 
At first, I wanted to use Java as it is known to be faster than Node.JS; however, Node.JS's seamless integration with front-end applications and my desire to save time with the 24-hour 
time limit led me to choose Node.JS. A decent amount of my time went into integrating Java with my front-end before the switch.

Other Documentation (Time Complexity):
I implemented most algorithms with O(n) time, and I avoided going into O(n^2) time for the whole project on any algorithms. 
For my sorting algorithm on the back end, I used merge sort, which has a worst case of O(n log n), to improve sorting efficiency. I was also able to use a hash map that had a key-value search time of O(n + m) for iterating through,
and O(1) for get() or set() function calls.

Overall, a very fun project to work on! Thanks for giving me the chance to complete it for Chartmetric!
